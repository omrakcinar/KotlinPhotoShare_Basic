# KotlinPhotoShare_Basic!

Hi i am a beginner level Android Kotlin Developer. I build basic apps to improve myself. 
PhotoShare is an app that you can sign up, share and see photos of other users. I used these while i building this app ;

> Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

> Recycler View & Adapter

> Picasso Android (https://github.com/square/picasso)

First you need to sign up for the app. Your informations are stored in Firebase servers. By Firebase authentication you can login to your account any time.
After you logged in to your account. You'll see a feed of other users in the app in a recycler view. You can share your post by clicking the plus button at the bottom bar.
Here are some screenshots of the app. I would be very happy to hear your feedbacks.
